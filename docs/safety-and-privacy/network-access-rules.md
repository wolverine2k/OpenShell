# Network Access Rules

Every outbound connection from a sandbox passes through NemoClaw's transparent
proxy. Nothing leaves the sandbox directly. The proxy identifies which binary
initiated the connection, evaluates the active policy, and decides what happens
next.

## How the Proxy Evaluates Connections

Each outbound connection resolves to one of three outcomes:

| Outcome                | When it applies                                                              | What happens                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allow              | A `network_policies` entry matches the destination host *and* the calling binary. | Traffic flows directly to the destination. The agent's own API key is used. |
| InspectForInference| No network policy matches, but `inference.allowed_routes` is configured.     | The proxy intercepts the connection and hands it to the privacy router, which reroutes it to a configured backend. The route's API key is used. |
| Deny               | No network policy matches and no inference route applies.                    | The connection is blocked. The calling process receives a 403 or connection reset. |

:::{note}
This is the most important distinction in NemoClaw's network model.

*Agent traffic* is the coding agent (Claude, OpenCode, Codex) calling its own API to get completions. This traffic matches a `network_policies` entry because the policy declares both the endpoint (for example, `api.anthropic.com:443`) and the binary (for example, `/usr/local/bin/claude`). The proxy allows it through directly. The agent's own API key (injected by the provider) is used as-is.

*Userland traffic* is code that the agent *writes* making inference calls. A Python script calling the OpenAI-compatible API, a data pipeline hitting an LLM endpoint, a test harness querying a model. This traffic does *not* match any network policy because the calling binary (`/usr/bin/python3`) is not listed in the agent's policy entry. The proxy intercepts it, the privacy router reroutes it to a configured backend, and the route's API key is substituted in. The agent's code never touches your real API key.

## Structure of a Network Policy Entry

Each entry in the `network_policies` section pairs a set of endpoints with a set of binaries. Only the listed binaries can connect to the listed endpoints:

```yaml
network_policies:
  my_rule:
    name: my-rule
    endpoints:
      - host: api.example.com
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        tls: terminate
        enforcement: enforce
        access: full
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/local/bin/my-agent
```

The key (`my_rule`) is a logical name for reference. The `name` field is the human-readable label that appears in logs and the NemoClaw Terminal.

## Endpoints

Each endpoint entry controls access to a single host-port combination. Refer to [Endpoint Object](../reference/policy-schema.md#endpoint-object) for the full field reference.

The `access` field provides presets: `full` (all methods), `read-only` (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`), or `read-write` (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`).

### Custom Rules

When access presets are not granular enough, define explicit allow rules. Each rule specifies a method and a path pattern:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - host: github.com
    port: 443
    protocol: rest
    tls: terminate
    enforcement: enforce
    rules:
      - allow:
          method: GET
          path: /**/info/refs*
      - allow:
          method: POST
          path: /**/git-upload-pack
```

This example allows Git fetch operations (read-only clone and pull) while blocking push operations. Path patterns use glob syntax.

If a request does not match any rule, it is denied (in `enforce` mode) or logged (in `audit` mode).

## Binaries

The `binaries` list specifies which executables are permitted to use the endpoint. Each entry has a `path` field that the proxy matches against the calling process.

The proxy resolves the calling binary through several mechanisms, evaluated in order:

| Match type        | Example | Description |
|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| Exact path        | `/usr/local/bin/claude` | Matches the binary at exactly this path. |
| Ancestor process  | `/usr/local/bin/claude` | Matches if any ancestor in the process tree has this path. A Node.js subprocess spawned by Claude matches a `claude` entry. |
| Cmdline path      | `/usr/local/bin/opencode` | Matches against `/proc/pid/cmdline` for interpreted languages where the `exe` link points to the interpreter. |
| Glob pattern      | `/sandbox/.vscode-server/**` | Matches any executable under the directory tree. |

```yaml
binaries:
  - path: /usr/local/bin/claude
  - path: /usr/bin/node
  - path: /sandbox/.vscode-server/**
```

## L7 Inspection

To inspect HTTPS traffic at the HTTP level, you need both `protocol: rest` and `tls: terminate` on the endpoint:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - host: api.example.com
    port: 443
    protocol: rest
    tls: terminate
    enforcement: enforce
    access: full
```

With both fields set, the proxy terminates the TLS connection, decrypts the HTTP request, evaluates it against the `access` preset or custom `rules`, and re-encrypts before forwarding to the destination.

:::{warning}
Without `tls: terminate` on port 443, the proxy cannot decrypt the traffic. L7 rules (`access`, `rules`) are not evaluated because the HTTP payload is encrypted. The connection is handled at L4 only: allowed or denied based on host and port, with no HTTP-level access control.
:::

### Bare Endpoints (L4-Only)

Endpoints declared without `protocol` or `tls` are L4-only:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - host: registry.npmjs.org
    port: 443
```

The proxy allows the TCP connection through to the destination without decrypting or inspecting the payload. Use L4-only entries for non-HTTP traffic, package registries where you need connectivity but not method-level control, or endpoints where TLS termination is not desired.

:::{warning}
With L4-only rules, you have no control over *what* is sent to the endpoint: only *whether* the connection is allowed. Any binary listed in the entry can send any data to the host. If you need to restrict HTTP methods or paths, add `protocol: rest` and `tls: terminate`.
:::

## Enforcement Modes

Each endpoint can operate in one of two enforcement modes:

| Mode      | Behavior on violation |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| `enforce` | Blocks the request and returns HTTP 403 to the calling process. The violation is logged. |
| `audit`   | Logs the violation but forwards the traffic to the destination. The agent is not interrupted. |

:::{tip}
Start with `enforcement: audit` when developing a new policy. Audit mode shows you what *would* be blocked without actually breaking the agent. After the policy is correct and you have confirmed that no legitimate traffic is flagged, switch to `enforcement: enforce`.
:::

## Putting It Together

Here is a realistic policy snippet for an agent that needs to reach its own API, clone Git repositories (read-only), and install npm packages:

```yaml
network_policies:
  agent_api:
    name: agent-api
    endpoints:
      - host: api.anthropic.com
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        tls: terminate
        enforcement: enforce
        access: full
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/local/bin/claude
      - path: /usr/bin/node

  github:
    name: github
    endpoints:
      - host: github.com
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        tls: terminate
        enforcement: enforce
        rules:
          - allow:
              method: GET
              path: /**/info/refs*
          - allow:
              method: POST
              path: /**/git-upload-pack
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/bin/git

  npm_registry:
    name: npm-registry
    endpoints:
      - host: registry.npmjs.org
        port: 443
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/bin/npm
      - path: /usr/bin/node
      - path: /usr/local/bin/npm
      - path: /usr/local/bin/node
```
