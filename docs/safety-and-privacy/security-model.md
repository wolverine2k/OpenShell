# The Security Model

When an AI agent runs with unrestricted access to your system, it can read any
file, reach any network host, call any API with your credentials, and install
arbitrary software. NemoClaw's security model exists to prevent all of that.

:::{note}
NemoClaw uses defense in depth. Filesystem restrictions, network policies,
process isolation, and explicit inference routing work together so that no
single point of failure can compromise your environment.
:::

## What Happens Without Protection

Autonomous agents are powerful, but power without boundaries is risk. Here are
four concrete threat scenarios and how NemoClaw addresses each one.

### Data Exfiltration

**Without protection:**
The agent writes a script that reads your source code and uploads it to an
external server using `curl`.

**With NemoClaw:**
The network policy blocks all outbound connections except to hosts you have
explicitly approved. The `curl` command to an unapproved destination is denied
at the proxy before the request ever leaves the sandbox.

---

### Credential Theft

**Without protection:**
The agent reads `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.aws/credentials`, or other sensitive files
from your home directory and exfiltrates them.

**With NemoClaw:**
Landlock filesystem restrictions limit the agent to declared paths. The agent
can access `/sandbox`, `/tmp`, and read-only system directories, but not your
home directory, SSH keys, cloud credentials, or anything else outside the
policy.

---

### Unauthorized API Calls

**Without protection:**
The agent code calls `api.openai.com` with your API key, sending proprietary
data to a third-party inference provider you did not approve.

**With NemoClaw:**
Userland code can call `https://inference.local`, and NemoClaw routes that
traffic to the configured backend using provider credentials stored outside the
sandboxed application. Direct calls to third-party endpoints still require an
explicit network policy. Your data does not silently fall through to an
unapproved provider.

---

### Privilege Escalation

**Without protection:**
The agent runs `sudo apt install` to install packages, modifies `/etc/passwd`,
or uses raw sockets to scan your internal network.

**With NemoClaw:**
The agent runs as an unprivileged user with seccomp filters that block
dangerous system calls. Landlock prevents writes outside allowed paths. There
is no `sudo`, no `setuid`, and no path to elevated privileges.

:::{important}
These layers work together. Filesystem restrictions do not prevent network
exfiltration. Network policies do not prevent local privilege escalation.
Process restrictions do not control where inference traffic goes. Defense in
depth means each layer covers gaps that the others cannot.

## Next Steps

- {doc}`policies`: Write and iterate on the policy YAML for filesystem, process, and network access
- {doc}`network-access-rules`: Configure network rules, binary matching, and TLS inspection
- {doc}`../inference/index`: Set up private inference backends
