NemoClaw is the safe, private runtime for autonomous AI agents. It provides sandboxed execution environments
that protect your data, credentials, and infrastructure. Agents run with exactly the permissions they need and
nothing more, governed by declarative policies that prevent unauthorized file access, data exfiltration, and
uncontrolled network activity.

## Get Started

Install the CLI and create your first sandbox in two commands. Refer to the [Quickstart](get-started/quickstart.md) to get up and running.

```console
$ pip install nemoclaw
$ nemoclaw sandbox create -- claude
```
