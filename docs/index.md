NemoClaw is the safe, private runtime for autonomous AI agents. It provides sandboxed execution environments 
that protect your data, credentials, and infrastructure. Agents run with exactly the permissions they need and 
nothing more, governed by declarative policies that prevent unauthorized file access, data exfiltration, and 
uncontrolled network activity.

## Install and Create a Sandbox

NemoClaw is designed for minimal setup with safety and privacy built in from the start. Two commands take you from zero to a running, policy-enforced sandbox.

### Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisites for the NemoClaw CLI.

- Docker must be running.
- Python 3.12+ is required.

### Install the NemoClaw CLI

```console
$ pip install nemoclaw
```

### Create Your First NemoClaw Sandbox

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Claude Code
```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox create -- claude
```

```text
✓ Runtime ready
✓ Discovered Claude credentials (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
✓ Created sandbox: keen-fox
✓ Policy loaded (4 protection layers active)

Connecting to keen-fox...
```

Claude Code works out of the box with the default policy.
:::

:::{tab-item} Community Sandbox
```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox create --from openclaw
```

The `--from` flag pulls from the [NemoClaw Community](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw-Community) catalog, which contains a collection of domain-specific sandbox images bundled with their own containers, policies, and skills.
:::

::::

The agent runs with filesystem, network, and process protection active. Credentials stay inside the sandbox, network access follows your policy, and private model access is available through `inference.local`. Sandbox policy is hot-reloadable for network rules, while cluster inference is configured separately.

For OpenCode or Codex, refer to the [](tutorials/run-opencode.md) tutorial for agent-specific setup.
