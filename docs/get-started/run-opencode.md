# Run OpenCode with NVIDIA Inference

This tutorial walks you through a realistic setup where you run [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) inside a NemoClaw sandbox with inference routed to NVIDIA API endpoints. Along the way, you will hit a policy denial, diagnose it from logs, write a custom policy, and configure inference routing. This is the full policy iteration loop that you will use whenever you onboard a new tool.

## What You Will Learn

- Create a provider manually using the `--from-existing` flag.
- Write a custom policy to replace the default policy.
- Read sandbox logs to diagnose denied actions.
- Distinguish between agent traffic and userland inference.
- Set up inference routes for code running inside the sandbox.

## Prerequisites

- Meet the prerequisites in the [Quickstart](quickstart.md).
- `NVIDIA_API_KEY` environment variable set on your host machine with a valid NVIDIA API key.

## Create the Provider

In the Claude Code tutorial, the CLI auto-discovered credentials. Here you create a provider explicitly, which gives you control over the provider name and type.

```console
$ nemoclaw provider create --name nvidia --type nvidia --from-existing
```

The `--from-existing` flag tells the CLI to discover credentials from your local environment. It finds `NVIDIA_API_KEY` and stores it securely. The provider is now available to attach to any sandbox.

Verify the provider exists:

```console
$ nemoclaw provider list
```

## Create the Sandbox

Create a sandbox with the NVIDIA provider attached and OpenCode as the startup command:

```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox create --name opencode-sandbox --provider nvidia --keep -- opencode
```

The `--keep` flag keeps the sandbox alive after you exit, which you need for the iteration steps ahead. The CLI creates the sandbox with the default policy, injects the NVIDIA credentials, and starts OpenCode.

## Hit a Policy Denial

Try using OpenCode inside the sandbox. You will find that calls to NVIDIA inference endpoints fail. The default policy is designed around Claude Code, not OpenCode, so the required endpoints are not allowlisted.

Open a second terminal and check the logs:

```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox logs opencode-sandbox --tail
```

Alternatively, launch the NemoClaw Terminal for a live view:

```console
$ nemoclaw term
```

Look for lines like these:

```
action=deny  host=integrate.api.nvidia.com  binary=/usr/local/bin/opencode  reason="no matching network policy"
action=deny  host=opencode.ai               binary=/usr/bin/node            reason="no matching network policy"
action=inspect_for_inference  host=integrate.api.nvidia.com  binary=/bin/bash
```

Each log entry tells you the exact host, binary, and reason for the denial.

## Understand the Denial

The default policy contains a `nvidia_inference` network policy entry, but it is configured for a narrow set of binaries — typically `/usr/local/bin/claude` and `/usr/bin/node`. When OpenCode makes HTTP calls through its own binary, `curl`, or a shell subprocess, those connections do not match any policy rule and get denied.

Two separate problems are at play:

- OpenCode's own traffic. OpenCode contacts `opencode.ai` for its API and `integrate.api.nvidia.com` for inference. Neither endpoint has a matching rule for the binaries OpenCode uses.
- Missing endpoint. The default policy has no entry for `opencode.ai` at all. Even if the binary matched, the destination is not listed.

This is expected behavior. NemoClaw denies everything by default. You need to write a policy that explicitly allows what OpenCode needs.

## Write a Custom Policy

Create a file called `opencode-policy.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: 1
inference:
  allowed_routes:
    - nvidia
filesystem_policy:
  include_workdir: true
  read_only:
    - /usr
    - /lib
    - /proc
    - /dev/urandom
    - /app
    - /etc
    - /var/log
  read_write:
    - /sandbox
    - /tmp
    - /dev/null
landlock:
  compatibility: best_effort
process:
  run_as_user: sandbox
  run_as_group: sandbox
network_policies:
  opencode_api:
    name: opencode-api
    endpoints:
      - host: opencode.ai
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        tls: terminate
        enforcement: enforce
        access: full
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/local/bin/opencode
      - path: /usr/bin/node
  nvidia_inference:
    name: nvidia-inference
    endpoints:
      - host: integrate.api.nvidia.com
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        tls: terminate
        enforcement: enforce
        access: full
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/local/bin/opencode
      - path: /usr/bin/node
      - path: /usr/bin/curl
      - path: /bin/bash
  npm_registry:
    name: npm-registry
    endpoints:
      - host: registry.npmjs.org
        port: 443
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/bin/npm
      - path: /usr/bin/node
      - path: /usr/local/bin/npm
      - path: /usr/local/bin/node
  github_rest_api:
    name: github-rest-api
    endpoints:
      - host: api.github.com
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        tls: terminate
        enforcement: enforce
        access: read-only
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/local/bin/opencode
      - path: /usr/bin/node
      - path: /usr/bin/gh
  github_ssh_over_https:
    name: github-ssh-over-https
    endpoints:
      - host: github.com
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        tls: terminate
        enforcement: enforce
        rules:
          - allow:
              method: GET
              path: "/**/info/refs*"
          - allow:
              method: POST
              path: "/**/git-upload-pack"
    binaries:
      - path: /usr/bin/git
```

This policy differs from the default in four key ways:

- `opencode_api`: Allows OpenCode and Node.js to reach `opencode.ai:443`.
- Broader `nvidia_inference` binaries: Adds `/usr/local/bin/opencode`, `/usr/bin/curl`, and `/bin/bash` so OpenCode's subprocesses can reach the NVIDIA endpoint.
- `inference.allowed_routes`: Includes `nvidia` so inference routing works for userland code.
- GitHub access: Scoped to support OpenCode's git operations.

:::{warning}
The `filesystem_policy`, `landlock`, and `process` sections are static. They are set at sandbox creation time and cannot be changed on a running sandbox. To modify these, delete and recreate the sandbox. The `network_policies` and `inference` sections are dynamic and can be hot-reloaded.
:::

## Apply the Policy

Push your custom policy to the running sandbox:

```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox policy set opencode-sandbox --policy opencode-policy.yaml --wait
```

The `--wait` flag blocks until the sandbox confirms the policy is loaded.

Verify the policy revision was accepted:

```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox policy list opencode-sandbox
```

The latest revision should show status `loaded`.

## Set Up Inference Routing

So far, you have allowed the OpenCode *agent* to reach `integrate.api.nvidia.com` directly through network policy. But code that OpenCode writes and runs inside the sandbox — scripts, notebooks, applications — uses a separate mechanism called the privacy router.

Create an inference route so userland code can access NVIDIA models:

```console
$ nemoclaw inference create \
  --routing-hint nvidia \
  --base-url https://integrate.api.nvidia.com \
  --model-id z-ai/glm5 \
  --api-key $NVIDIA_API_KEY
```

The policy you wrote earlier already includes `nvidia` in `inference.allowed_routes`, so no policy update is needed. If you had omitted it, you would add the route to the policy and push again.

:::{note}
*Network policies* and *inference routes* are two separate enforcement points. Network policies control which hosts the agent binary can reach directly. Inference routes control where LLM API calls from userland code get routed through the privacy proxy.
:::

## Verify the Policy

Tail the logs again:

```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox logs opencode-sandbox --tail
```

You should no longer see `action=deny` lines for the endpoints you added. Connections to `opencode.ai`, `integrate.api.nvidia.com`, and GitHub should show `action=allow`.

If you still see denials, read the log line carefully. It tells you the exact host, port, and binary that was blocked. Add the missing entry to your policy and push again with `nemoclaw sandbox policy set`. This observe-modify-push cycle is the normal workflow for onboarding any new tool in NemoClaw.

## Clean Up

When you are finished, delete the sandbox:

```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox delete opencode-sandbox
```
