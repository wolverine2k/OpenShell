# Quickstart

This page gets you from zero to a running, policy-enforced sandbox in two commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Docker Desktop running on your machine.

For a complete list of requirements, refer to {doc}`../reference/support-matrix`.

## Install the OpenShell CLI

Run the install script:

```console
$ curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/main/install.sh | sh
```

If you prefer [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```console
$ uv tool install -U openshell
```

:::{tip}
Run `openshell --help` in your terminal to see the full CLI reference, including all commands and flags. You can also clone the [NVIDIA OpenShell GitHub repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) and use the `/openshell-cli` skill to load the CLI reference into your agent.
:::

## Create Your First OpenShell Sandbox

Create a sandbox and launch an agent inside it.
Choose the tab that matches your agent:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Claude Code

Run the following command to create a sandbox with Claude Code:

```console
$ openshell sandbox create -- claude
```

The CLI prompts you to create a provider from local credentials.
Type `yes` to continue.
If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in your environment, the CLI picks it up automatically.
If not, you can configure it from inside the sandbox after it launches.
:::

:::{tab-item} OpenCode

Run the following command to create a sandbox with OpenCode:

```console
$ openshell sandbox create -- opencode
```

The CLI prompts you to create a provider from local credentials.
Type `yes` to continue.
If `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in your environment, the CLI picks it up automatically.
If not, you can configure it from inside the sandbox after it launches.
:::

:::{tab-item} Codex

Run the following command to create a sandbox with Codex:

```console
$ openshell sandbox create -- codex
```

The CLI prompts you to create a provider from local credentials.
Type `yes` to continue.
If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment, the CLI picks it up automatically.
If not, you can configure it from inside the sandbox after it launches.
:::

:::{tab-item} OpenClaw

Run the following command to create a sandbox with OpenClaw:

```console
$ openshell sandbox create --from openclaw
```

The `--from` flag pulls a pre-built sandbox definition from the [OpenShell Community](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell-Community) catalog.
Each definition bundles a container image, a tailored policy, and optional skills into a single package.
:::

:::{tab-item} Community Sandbox

Use the `--from` flag to pull other OpenShell sandbox images from the [NVIDIA Container Registry](https://registry.nvidia.com/).
For example, to pull the `base` image, run the following command:

```console
$ openshell sandbox create --from base
```

## Deploy a Gateway (Optional)

Running `openshell sandbox create` without a gateway auto-bootstraps a local one.
To start the gateway explicitly or deploy to a remote host, choose the tab that matches your setup.

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} Brev

:::{note}
Deploy an OpenShell gateway on Brev by clicking **Deploy** on the [OpenShell Launchable](https://brev.nvidia.com/launchable/deploy/now?launchableID=env-3Ap3tL55zq4a8kew1AuW0FpSLsg).
:::

After the instance starts running, find the gateway URL in the Brev console under **Using Secure Links**.
Copy the shareable URL for **port 8080**, which is the gateway endpoint.

```console
$ openshell gateway add https://<your-port-8080-url>.brevlab.com
$ openshell status
```

::::

::::{tab-item} DGX Spark

:::{note}
Set up your Spark with NVIDIA Sync first, or make sure SSH access is configured (such as SSH keys added to the host).
:::

Deploy to a DGX Spark machine over SSH:

```console
$ openshell gateway start --remote <username>@<spark-ssid>.local
$ openshell status
```

After `openshell status` shows the gateway as healthy, all subsequent commands route through the SSH tunnel.
