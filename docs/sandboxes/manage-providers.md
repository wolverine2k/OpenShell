# Manage Providers and Credentials

AI agents typically need credentials to access external services: an API key for the AI model provider, a token for GitHub or GitLab, and so on. OpenShell manages these credentials as first-class entities called *providers*.

Create and manage providers that supply credentials to sandboxes.

## Create a Provider

Providers can be created from local environment variables or with explicit credential values.

### From Local Credentials

The fastest way to create a provider is to let the CLI discover credentials from
your shell environment:

```console
$ openshell provider create --name my-claude --type claude --from-existing
```

This reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_API_KEY` from your current environment
and stores them in the provider.

### With Explicit Credentials

Supply a credential value directly:

```console
$ openshell provider create --name my-api --type generic --credential API_KEY=sk-abc123
```

### Bare Key Form

Pass a key name without a value to read the value from the environment variable
of that name:

```console
$ openshell provider create --name my-api --type generic --credential API_KEY
```

This looks up the current value of `$API_KEY` in your shell and stores it.

## Manage Providers

List, inspect, update, and delete providers from the active cluster.

List all providers:

```console
$ openshell provider list
```

Inspect a provider:

```console
$ openshell provider get my-claude
```

Update a provider's credentials:

```console
$ openshell provider update my-claude --type claude --from-existing
```

Delete a provider:

```console
$ openshell provider delete my-claude
```

## Attach Providers to Sandboxes

Pass one or more `--provider` flags when creating a sandbox:

```console
$ openshell sandbox create --provider my-claude --provider my-github -- claude
```

Each `--provider` flag attaches one provider. The sandbox receives all
credentials from every attached provider at runtime.

:::{warning}
Providers cannot be added to a running sandbox. If you need to attach an
additional provider, delete the sandbox and recreate it with all required
providers specified.
:::

### Auto-Discovery Shortcut

When the trailing command in `openshell sandbox create` is a recognized tool name (`claude`, `codex`, or `opencode`), the CLI auto-creates the required
provider from your local credentials if one does not already exist. You do not
need to create the provider separately:

```console
$ openshell sandbox create -- claude
```

This detects `claude` as a known tool, finds your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, creates
a provider, attaches it to the sandbox, and launches Claude Code.

## Supported Provider Types

The following provider types are supported.

| Type | Environment Variables Injected | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_API_KEY` | Claude Code, Anthropic API |
| `codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI Codex |
| `opencode` | `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` | opencode tool |
| `github` | `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub API, `gh` CLI — refer to {doc}`/tutorials/github-sandbox` |
| `gitlab` | `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GLAB_TOKEN`, `CI_JOB_TOKEN` | GitLab API, `glab` CLI |
| `nvidia` | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | NVIDIA API Catalog |
| `generic` | User-defined | Any service with custom credentials |
| `outlook` | *(none: no auto-discovery)* | Microsoft Outlook integration |

:::{tip}
Use the `generic` type for any service not listed above. You define the
environment variable names and values yourself with `--credential`.
