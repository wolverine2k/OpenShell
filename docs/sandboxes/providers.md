# Providers

AI agents typically need credentials to access external services: an API key for the AI model provider, a token for GitHub or GitLab, and so on. NemoClaw manages these credentials as first-class entities called *providers*.

Create and manage providers that supply credentials to sandboxes.

## Create a Provider

Providers can be created from local environment variables or with explicit credential values.

### From Local Credentials

The fastest way to create a provider is to let the CLI discover credentials from
your shell environment:

```console
$ nemoclaw provider create --name my-claude --type claude --from-existing
```

This reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_API_KEY` from your current environment
and stores them in the provider.

### With Explicit Credentials

Supply a credential value directly:

```console
$ nemoclaw provider create --name my-api --type generic --credential API_KEY=sk-abc123
```

### Bare Key Form

Pass a key name without a value to read the value from the environment variable
of that name:

```console
$ nemoclaw provider create --name my-api --type generic --credential API_KEY
```

This looks up the current value of `$API_KEY` in your shell and stores it.

## Manage Providers

List, inspect, update, and delete providers from the active cluster.

List all providers:

```console
$ nemoclaw provider list
```

Inspect a provider:

```console
$ nemoclaw provider get my-claude
```

Update a provider's credentials:

```console
$ nemoclaw provider update my-claude --type claude --from-existing
```

Delete a provider:

```console
$ nemoclaw provider delete my-claude
```

## Attach Providers to Sandboxes

Pass one or more `--provider` flags when creating a sandbox:

```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox create --provider my-claude --provider my-github -- claude
```

Each `--provider` flag attaches one provider. The sandbox receives all
credentials from every attached provider at runtime.

:::{warning}
Providers cannot be added to a running sandbox. If you need to attach an
additional provider, delete the sandbox and recreate it with all required
providers specified.
:::

### Auto-Discovery Shortcut

When the trailing command in `nemoclaw sandbox create` is a recognized tool name (`claude`, `codex`, or `opencode`), the CLI auto-creates the required
provider from your local credentials if one does not already exist. You do not
need to create the provider separately:

```console
$ nemoclaw sandbox create -- claude
```

This detects `claude` as a known tool, finds your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, creates
a provider, attaches it to the sandbox, and launches Claude Code.

## How Credentials Flow

Credentials follow a secure path from your machine into the agent process.

```

1. You create a provider with credentials from your environment or
   specified explicitly.
2. You attach the provider to a sandbox at creation time using the
   `--provider` flag (one or more providers can be attached).
3. The sandbox starts. The supervisor process initializes.
4. The supervisor fetches credentials from the NemoClaw gateway at runtime.
   The system does not store credentials in the sandbox specification. It retrieves them on demand.
5. Credentials are injected into the agent process as environment variables.
   They are also available in SSH sessions when you connect to the sandbox.

:::{warning}
The system does not store credentials in the sandbox container specification. The supervisor fetches them at runtime and holds them only in process memory. This
means you cannot find credentials in container inspection, image layers, or
environment dumps of the container spec.

## Supported Provider Types

The following provider types are supported.

| Type | Environment Variables Injected | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_API_KEY` | Claude Code, Anthropic API |
| `codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI Codex |
| `OpenCode` | `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` | opencode tool |
| `github` | `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` | GitHub API, `gh` CLI |
| `gitlab` | `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GLAB_TOKEN`, `CI_JOB_TOKEN` | GitLab API, `glab` CLI |
| `nvidia` | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | NVIDIA API Catalog |
| `generic` | User-defined | Any service with custom credentials |
| `outlook` | *(none: no auto-discovery)* | Microsoft Outlook integration |

:::{tip}
Use the `generic` type for any service not listed above. You define the
environment variable names and values yourself with `--credential`.
